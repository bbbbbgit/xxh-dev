# xxh-tests
Test environment for xonssh/xxh

1. Create `./xxh` directory with xxh code. If you skip this step the directory will be created from github master.
2. Run `start_test_env.xsh`. It builds docker container with tests and with ssh server and run tests. 
3. Now you can edit and commit the code in `./xxh` and `./tests`.
4. When you need to run tests just use last line from `start_test_env.xsh` 

Thank you for your help!
